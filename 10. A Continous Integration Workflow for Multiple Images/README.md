## Multiple Services Integration

### Production Multi-Container Deployments
Push code to GitHub ðŸ ² Travis automatically pulls repo ðŸ ² Travis builds a test image, tests code ðŸ ² Travis builds prod images ðŸ ² Travis pushes built prod images to Docker Hub ðŸ ² Travis pushes project to AWS EB ðŸ ² EB pull images from Docker Hub, deploys

### Production Dockerfiles
Worker [Dockerfile](source code)<br/>
Server [Dockerfile](source code)<br/>
Nginx [Dockerfile](source code)<br/>

### Multiple Nginx Instances
There will be multiple nginx instances this time. Routing, nginx with production react files etc.

### Alterning Nginx's Listen Port
Nginx [default.cong](source code)<br/>
Client [Dockerfile](source code)<br/>

### Travis Configuration Setup
Specify docker as a dependency ðŸ ² Build test version of React project ðŸ ² Run tests ðŸ ² Build production version of all projects ðŸ ² Push all to Docker Hub ðŸ ² Tell EB to update

As a before_install step, we will be building the test version of client project and run some tests inside of it. For this, we will be using the development Dockerfile.dev .

```bash

sudo: required
servives:
    - docker

before_install:
    - docler build -t cry0genic/react-test -f ./client/Dockerfile.dev ./client

script:
    - docker run cry0genic/react-test npm test -- --coverage

after_success:
    - docker run -t cry0genic/multi-client ./client 
    - docker run -t cry0genic/multi-nginx ./nginx
    - docker run -t cry0genic/multi-server ./server
    - docker run -t cry0genic/multi-worker ./worker
```

### Pushing Images to Docker Hub
Add DOCKER_ID and DOCKER_PASSWORD in the environment variable provided by Travis CI. 

``` - echo "$DOCKER_PASSWORD" | docker login -u "$DOCKER_ID" --password-stdin ``` 

The echo part is going to retrieve your docker password from the enviroment variable and essentially emit that over STDIN as input to the next command.

Now push all the changes to GitHub and let Travis do it's thing.
